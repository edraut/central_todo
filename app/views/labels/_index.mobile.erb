    <p class="explanatory">
    Labels are places or objects which are necessary to complete a task. They are different from projects because tasks that belong to a project are related by a common goal, while tasks that belong to a label are only related by the place or object required.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
    If I'm building a new dining table, I might create a Dining Table project. Within that project I might list tasks like 'design table', 'research building materials', 'buy materials', and 'build table'. Those tasks are all related by the goal of building a new dining table. I might need to be at my desk to design the table, but I might need to be on the phone to research building materials, and I might need to be in my car to buy the materials. 'Desk', 'Phone', and 'Car' are all examples of Labels you might want to create and use.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
    I might also be planning a party around the same time as I'm building my dining table. 'Invite guests' might require that I be at my desk, while 'research party supplies' might require that I be on my phone, and 'buy party supplies' might require that I be in my car.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
    If I've added all the party planning and dining table tasks to the appropriate labels, the next time I've got some time at my desk I could design my table and invite my guests. Later I have some time with my phone so I research dining table materials and party supplies. The next day I have some time in my car so I buy the materials for my table and party supplies. I've become more efficient by using Labels.
